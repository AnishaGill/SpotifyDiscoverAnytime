# Spotify Discover Anytime

Created to solve the problem of Spotify's user-curated Discover Weekly Playlists disappearing, unless downloaded by the user within a week. Spotify updates each user's Discover Weekly Playlist every week with new, and alternative music. A new Discover Weekly Playlist appears to replace the old as a way to expose users to new and alternative music.
Utilized multiple endpoints in the Spotify API to access data, and automated with Python to create a project that clones your Discover Weekly Playlist instance every week and adds it to your Spotify Library.
